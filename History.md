##  v0.3.0 [2017-05-31] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Changes:

- Rename Assemblage to Archetype to follow Artemis's naming.
- Rename Entity#get_component to #find_component to more accurately
  reflect what it does. Aliased to the old name for backward
  compatibility, but the alias will likely be removed before 1.0.

Enhancements:

- Add a Chione::Component() coercion method
- Allow a component to be added to an entity by name or class
- Add an #entities method to System for easy iteration by subclasses.
- Change the return value of World#entities_for to an Enumerator for
  future optimizations.

Bugfixes:

- Add a missing private method to Component


##  v0.2.0 [2017-05-26] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Enhancements:

- Make Assemblage, Component, Manager and System all pluggable.
- Don't assume the process model of Systems
- Extract a method for creating blank Entities to facilitate
  overriding which Entity class is used.
- Defer event processing until the event loop so events which are
  published at startup aren't missed.
- Allow shorthand required component list for system aspects


##  v0.1.0 [2017-05-22] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Enhancements:

- Refactor the World start/stop logic to make it easier to override in
  implementations which have their own process models.
- Allow a component's default to be generated by a callable

Bugfixes:

- Stringify the Manager or System class in `manager/added` and `system/added`
  events.


## v0.0.3 [2017-01-04] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Enhancements:

- Add a proper #inspect to Component

Bugfixes:

- Fix misnamed attr in World, update to latest Configurability syntax
- Fix some documentation typos.
